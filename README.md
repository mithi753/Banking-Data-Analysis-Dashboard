# Banking Data Analysis & Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project focuses on **[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TfEyuV9tWSQb7gHn4NIWYlGN6Gb8xEIl?usp=sharing)** and **[Business Intelligence Dashboarding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zijrmNvRPZyj8N3GXCxLfybsKVg50VjA/view?usp=sharing)** using **[banking sector data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPXIKw0eSMZm0On-9-AqaVwMBAyH2GZk/view?usp=sharing)**.
The goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and financial trends, and to visualize them in an interactive dashboard.

## Components
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 * Conducted using Python
 * Includes data cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization
 * Helps in identifying key insights, trends, and anomalies in banking data
### Power BI Dashboard
* Built using Power BI 
* Provides an interactive interface for exploring KPIs and banking metrics
* Visualizes transaction patterns, customer demographics, and account performance
## Tools & Technologies
* **Python** → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Jupyter Notebook** → For EDA and visualization
* **Power BI** → Interactive dashboard design
* **SQL** → Data querying and transformation
## Key Insights (Example)
* Transaction volume and customer demographics trends
* High-value customers identified through spending patterns
* Account activity segmented by different customer categories
* Seasonal variations in customer deposits and withdrawals

## Further Analysis
This work can be extended for deeper insights, such as:
* **Customer Segmentation** → Using clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify distinct customer groups.
* **Churn Prediction** → Building machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to leave.
* **Credit Risk Analysis** → Evaluating loan repayment patterns and detecting potential defaults.
* **Forecasting** → Applying time-series analysis to predict future transactions, deposits, and withdrawals.
* **Anomaly Detection** → Detecting unusual or fraudulent transactions using statistical or ML techniques.
* **Profitability Analysis** → Measuring customer lifetime value (CLV) and identifying the most profitable segments.
